aperture
========

Calculate angular correction function and the distribution of momentum
transfers q contributing to an electron energy-loss spectrum recorded
using a finite collection aperture in the TEM and STEM. For a detailed
description see [1] (an supplemental material in [1]).

EXAMPLES

The scripts include examples at the end of each file. To run these
examples, first add the root directory to the Python search path

$ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<TEMareels_ROOT>

and execute the scripts using

$ python TEM_wqslit.py
$ python STEM_onaxis.py 



ISSUES
